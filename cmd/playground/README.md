# Playground

The Playground is where you can run the poller locally against a containerized
SQS service.

Run ```go run main.go``` to see the poller in action. Experiment with the poller by
sending messages from the command line, altering the code or changing the configuration
variables.

Run ```go run main.go --help``` to see what configurations variables are available.

## Prequisites

Before running the playground poller, make sure docker is installed and running on your machine.
